## Introduction
Squigl is a Twitter clone, a social network built using the Django framework. Deployed to Gitpod.  

This is the fourth milestone project required to complete my Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/). I was required to build a Full-Stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. With an authentication mechanism that provides role-based access to the site's data. This was achieved using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and the Django framework paired with a relational database.  

The name comes from the use of ~ in front of usernames, used here in a similar fashion to @username tags on Twitter. The tilde symbol is on the same keyboard key as # (on a UK keyboard) so it was a natural pairing for me. Its appearance as a squiggly line inspired the projectâ€™s name.  

The idea behind Squigl was to create an alternative to Twitter. I started on this project during the beginning of the recent Elon Musk Twitter drama. Basing this project on a pre-existing website helped aid planning early on, establishing expected goals and requirements for end users.  

Squigl allows users to post short posts on their customizable profile pages. Follow other users, like, and comment on posts. Send private messages to each other. Be notified when they are mentioned. See popular trending topics or search for users and posts by a phrase keyword.

## Project Planning

### GitHub Project
The GitHub project board feature was used to keep track of what I was working on and what still needed to be done. I created a user story for each feature and moved them when necessary throughout the development of the site.

![Github Project Board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-project-board.png)

### Database Schema
The models required for this project are:

 - **Post** - for user posts.
 - **Reply** - for replies to the posts.
 - **Message** - for private messaging between users
 - **CustomUser** - my custom user model which includes additional fields for a user to customize their profile.

### Timeboxing

Using MoSCoW prioritisation I categorised the features needed to meet the requirements of the user stories into the following categories:

#### Must Do

The final version of Squigl must be able to do the following:
- User signup
- User login
- Make new posts
- View posts
- Edit posts
- Delete posts

This would produce the **minimal viable product**.

#### Should Do

A more fully featured product would contain these features:
- Search
- Replying to posts
- Reading replies
- Editing replies
- Deleting replies
- Post liking
- Follow and unfollow users
- User settings

#### Could Do

And if there is extra time before then end these features could be included:
- User profile customisation
- User to user private messaging
- Notifications

An early version of Squigl would contain the following - every **must do** feature, from **should do**: post replying, user following, and from **could do:** user profile customisation (time permitting). Futher features can be added in later versions.

Fortunately due to the length of this project I was able to produce every feature.

## User Experience

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq for Desktop](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) was used ahead of development to plan the basic skeleton of all pages. You can download my wireframes file [here](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/documentation/squigl-wireframes.bmpr).

### Design Choices

#### Typography

Fonts are imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). The font used for the website logo and some usernames is [Fredoka One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fredoka+One). To keep visual clutter to a minimum only two fonts are used. Fredoka One for elements that are important to the current page, and for the rest of the content the default bootstrap font is used. Simply increasing the font-weight creates enough contrast between titles and body text.

![Squigl logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-logo.png)

#### Images

The only images used on the website are those **added by users**. These include profile backgrounds, user avatars and images shared in posts. This keeps the focus where it should be - on the user generated content. A placeholder image is used in cases where a user has not yet uploaded an avatar.

![Placeholder avatar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-avatar.png)

#### Colour Scheme

Squigl uses a restrained colour-scheme. The design focuses mainly on off black text on a white background. The main content column is highlighted by a grey gradient background to draw user's eyes to the middle of the page. Colour mostly comes from the content added by users. 

The colours used in the site logo represent two of the main pillars of squigl - users and trending topics. The letter "i" coloured goldenrod represents the users, as the "i" looks like a person and the colour is also used for the *verified tick* next to usernames. The indigo ~ is the same colour used for hashtags.

![Colour palette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-colours.png)

#### Layout

In desktop view the website is structured into three columns. The first being for navigation, the centre for the main content, and the right sidebar is for extra content. The centre column is the largest to highlight it's importance and draw the eye.

For smaller screens such as mobile the navigation shrinks and the right side bar hides - keeping focus on the centre column. The menu will include links to the Trending Hashtags and the Who To Follow pages when the right sidebar is hidden due to screen size.

## Features

### Site-wide features

#### Header

- The header featured on every page is made of three parts. The site logo, a search box, and the logged in user's info. 
- The logo returns a logged in user to their feed.
- Having search in the header encourages users to explore squigl. 
- The user info links the user to their page and helps show that the user is signed in.

![Header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-header.png)

#### Navigation

- The user will navigate to all the main pages of the site using the menu in the left sidebar. Depending on the status of the current user this menu changes. 
- A logged out or new user will see the options to login and sign up. 
- A logged in user will see the full list of menu options. 
- A moderator will see two further options, one for the Django admin and another for the moderation tools.
- Labels are removed from the menu at lower screen widths, on mobile this is then replaced with an expandable hamburger menu.
- If the logged in user has any unread mentions or messages the relevant menu link is highlighted and includes a count.

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-mobile-nav.png">
</details>

#### Scroll To Top Button

- A back to top button appears when scrolling below the header to further assist navigation. 
- The JavaScript code that makes this work can be found in [this file](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/static/js/script.js).

#### Centre Column

- The centre column houses the main content on every page, and is the only column to remain visible at every screen size.

#### Sidebar

- On the majority of pages the sidebar will show a list of recent trending hashtags and a random list of unfollowed users.
- On the post page the user will find the reply form here.

#### User Tagging

- User's can mention/tag other users in their posts, replies and messages by using ~ in front of their username.
- This functionality is made possible using JavaScript, the code that makes this work can be found in [templates/base.html](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/templates/base.html).
- This code is included in the html file because it requires django template tags to function. 

#### Hashtags

- Users can include hashtags in their posts and replies by using # in front of the desired keyword.
- This functionality is made possible using JavaScript, the code that makes this work can be found in [templates/base.html](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/templates/base.html).
- This code is included in the html file because it requires django template tags to function. 

**Example of a post with a tagged user and hashtags:**

![A post containing user tags and hashtags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-hash-tag.png)

#### Trending Hashtags

- JavaScript looks for a hidden `<div>` containing the last 100 posts that include `#` or in other words, a hashtag.
- The hashtag form inner html is extracted, the number of occurrences are counted, then sorted by value.
- Finally keys from this created JavaScript object are appended into the page html.
- The code that makes this work can be found in [this file](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/static/js/script.js).

![Trending Hashtags](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-trending.png)

#### Modals
Modals are used where it's possible to make permanent irreversible changes. Giving the user a chance to reconsider.
- Deleting a post
- Deleting a reply
- Deleting a message
- Reporting a post
- Reporting a reply
- Reporting a message
- Moderator functions
- Account deletion

**Modal example:**

![Modal example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-modal.png)

#### Django Messages
Django messages are implemented to provide the user confirmation of their actions.

### Specific pages

#### Error pages

- There are error pages for error [404](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/templates/404.html), [500](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/templates/500.html), and a [third one](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/templates/error.html) for squigl specific error messages.
- A bootstrap alert is used to display the relevant error message.
- A button using JavaScript can send the user back one page if they want.
- Custom error messages are sent to the page from the relevant `views.py` file, often the else result of an if statement.

```
else:
        e = 'You can not delete this post because you are not the author.'
        return render(request, 'error.html', {'e': e})
```
**Error 404 example:**

![Error display](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-error.png)

#### Login and Sign up

- The default django login and sign up forms are used. Using [accounts/forms.py](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/accounts/forms.py) I have added placeholder text to the html inputs to assist the user when signing up.
- In my CustomUser model I made email a requirement, this is so the user can reset their password, and this is reflected while signing up.
- The login page includes a link to password reset.
- Login is required for most of the functionality. A `@login_required` decorator is used where possible. In cases where this is not an alert will notify the user.
- A logged out user will be redirected to the login page if they attempt any of these actions:
    - Change account settings such as password
    - View, send, mark read, delete, report or reply to messages
    - Any moderation only action
    - View feed
    - Make a new post
    - Repost a post
    - Report a post
    - Follow or unfollow a suer
    - View mentions
    - Mark posts and replies as read

**New user sign up form**

![User sign up form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-signup.png)

#### Feed
- The home page for a logged in user.
- The feed displays a timeline of all the user's post and the posts of followed users.
- If there are no posts to display the user is encouraged to find users to follow.
- 20 posts are shown at a time, with pagination at the bottom so the user can navigate further into the timeline.
```
def feed(request):
    following = request.user.following
    posts = Post.objects.filter(
        Q(user__in=following.all()) | Q(user=request.user))
    paginator = Paginator(posts, 20)
    page_number = request.GET.get('page')
    page_obj = paginator.get_page(page_number)
    return render(request, 'social/feed.html', {
        'post_count': posts.count(),
        'page_obj': page_obj,
    })
```

**An example feed:**

![Feed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-feed.png)

#### Search

- All users can search squigl.
- The user input in the search form is used to filter through posts, replies, and users.
- Results can be filtered using the navigation below the page title.
- The number of results in each category are displayed.
- Replies shown in search results contain a link to the post they are a part of.
```
def search(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        query = request.POST['query'].strip().lower()
        users = CustomUser.objects.filter(
            Q(username__icontains=query) | Q(name__icontains=query)).order_by(
                'username')
        posts = Post.objects.filter(
            post__icontains=query).order_by('-date')
        replies = Reply.objects.filter(
            reply__icontains=query).exclude(hidden=True).order_by('-date')
        return render(request, 'social/search.html', {
            'query': query,
            'posts': posts,
            'users': users,
            'replies': replies,
        })
    else:
        return render(request, 'social/search.html')
```

#### User Page

- Every user that signs up has a profile page.
- This is where a user's posts will be shown regardless of if you follow them or not.
- Includes buttons to **Message** and **Follow/Unfollow** the user.
- If this is the logged in user's page then a **Edit Profile** button is shown instead.
- The user can choose to upload and display an avatar, a profile background image, a short description about themselves, change their profile name, and add a link to a website.
- User stats are also shown: Number of followers, number of users they are following, and number of posts.
- Like the Feed page, user posts are paginated.
```
def user(request, user):
    queryset = CustomUser.objects
    user = get_object_or_404(queryset, username=user)
    posts = Post.objects.filter(user_id=user.id).order_by('-date')
    following = False
    paginator = Paginator(posts, 20)
    page_number = request.GET.get('page')
    page_obj = paginator.get_page(page_number)
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        if request.user.following.filter(id=user.id):
            following = True
    return render(request, 'social/user.html', {
        'user': user,
        'page_obj': page_obj,
        'post_count': posts.count(),
        'following': following,
    })
```

**User page example:**

![User page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-user.png)

#### New Post

- Placeholder text is included to guide a user when making a new post. You can see the code [here](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/social/forms.py).
- A user has the option to include an image and/or a link to a website.
- Using the [django-reszied](https://pypi.org/project/django-resized/) package images are scaled to a width of 600px, this ensures images being shared with users of the website are not a large file size. This also has hosting benefits as well. Images are stored on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/).
- Once the form is submitted the user is redirected to the page for that post. 

```
def new_post(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = PostForm(request.POST, request.FILES or None)
        if form.is_valid():
            post = form.save(commit=False)
            post.user = request.user
            post.save()
            return redirect('post', post.id)
    else:
        return render(request, 'new/new-post.html', {'form': PostForm()})
```
**New post form:**

![New post form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-newpost.png)

#### Post Page

- Each post has its own page, this can be accessed by clicking the post timestamp or permalink in the footer.
- On the post page a user can read and post their own replies.
- The date of the post is represented in a few ways.
    - If the post is less than a minute old it shows as "Now".
    - If the post is less than 24 hours old then "X hours ago" is shown.
    - If the post is greater than 24 hours old then the published date will be shown.
- Each post shows a like count, reply count, repost count and a menu with further options. These are also shown wherever a post is displayed (feed, user page and search results).
- If the logged in user has replied and/or liked a post the relevant icons will be filled in.
- Clicking the repost icon or count will let the user repost the post by including it in a post of their own.
- A user can like a post without the need for a page reload thanks to Ajax. This code can be found [here](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/templates/templates/post-template.html).
- Each post contains a drop down menu which includes the option to **Report** the post and a **Permalink**. If the logged in user is the author of the post, they will also see the **Edit/Delete** option. 
- Each reply contains a button to **Report** the reply. If the logged in user is the author of the reply, they will also see the **Edit/Delete** option.

```
def post(request, post_id):
    post = get_object_or_404(Post, id=post_id)
    replies = Reply.objects.filter(post_id=post_id).order_by('-date')
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = ReplyForm(data=request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            form.instance.user = request.user
            form.instance.post = post
            form.save()
            return HttpResponseRedirect(request.path_info)
    else:
        return render(request, 'social/post.html', {
            'post': post,
            'replies': replies,
            'form': ReplyForm(),
        })
```

**An example of a post with replies:**

![New post form](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-post.png)

#### Mentions

- If a user is mentioned in a public post or reply they will be notified of this by an unread mention count in the menu.
- A user can view these posts and replies on their Mentions page.
- Posts and replies are excluded if the logged in user exists in their **read** `ManyToManyField`.
- Posts and replies can be marked as **Read** to clear the notification, and be excluded in the future.

```
def mentions(request):
    posts = Post.objects.filter(post__icontains=request.user).exclude(
        read=request.user).order_by('-date')
    replies = Reply.objects.filter(reply__icontains=request.user).exclude(
        hidden=True).exclude(read=request.user).order_by('-date')
    return render(request, 'social/mentions.html', {
        'posts': posts,
        'replies': replies,
    })
```

**An example of a user's mentions:**

![User mentions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paulio11/project-4/main/documentation/images/readme-mentions.png)

#### Messages

- Two logged in users can privately message each other.
- A user can either be messaged using the **Message** button on their user page, or by replying to a message they have previously sent.
- As with mentions above, a user is notified of any unread messages with a count in the menu.
- A user can view unread, read and sent messages using the message page navigation.
- Each message has a drop down menu with the options **Mark Read**, **Reply**, **Report**, and **Delete**.
- If a sent message has been read by the recipient, the sender is notified.
- Messages from website moderators (django staff role) are labeled.
- A user can chose to delete a message. The message remains in the database until both the sender and recipient have both chosen to delete it.

```
def messages(request):
    unread_messages = Message.objects.filter(
        recipient=request.user).filter(read=False).order_by('-date')
    messages = Message.objects.filter(
        recipient=request.user).filter(read=True).exclude(
            recipient_del=True).order_by('-date')
    sent_messages = Message.objects.filter(
        sender=request.user).exclude(sender_del=True).order_by('-date')
    return render(request, 'dm/messages.html', {
        'unread_messages': unread_messages,
        'messages': messages,
        'sent_messages': sent_messages})
```

**Example unread messages:**

**Example sent messages:**

#### Moderation

- Squigl moderators have access to the moderation page.
- Posts, replies and messages reported by users can be viewed here by moderators.
- A moderator can decide whether to ignore a report and mark the content as okay, or if necessary delete the content which will remove it and give the author a strike.
- Users with strikes can be viewed and messaged and banned or unbanned if necessary.
- All tables can be sorted by clicking on a column header. The code for this can be found [here](https://github.com/paulio11/project-4/blob/main/static/js/script.js).

```
def moderation(request):
    if request.user.is_staff:
        reported_posts = Post.objects.annotate(
            nreports=Count('reported')).filter(nreports__gt=0)
        reported_replies = Reply.objects.annotate(
            nreports=Count('reported')).filter(nreports__gt=0)
        reported_messages = Message.objects.filter(reported=True)
        users = CustomUser.objects.filter(strikes__gt=0).order_by('-strikes')
        return render(
            request,
            'moderation/moderation.html', {
                'reported_posts': reported_posts,
                'reported_replies': reported_replies,
                'reported_messages': reported_messages,
                'users': users,
                })
    else:
        e = 'Only Squigl moderators can view this page.'
        return render(request, 'error.html', {'e': e})
```

### Unimplemented Features

If possible I would have liked to have implemented the following features:
- A dark mode theme.
- The ability to post other media such as videos including YouTube embeds.
- A server side trending hashtags list. The current implementation is built with JavaScript that runs client side.
- Improvements to the user pages, including a gallery of their shared images, and a list of their liked posts.
- Reposts would notify the author of the original post.
- Further styling. In my opinion this still looks too much like a Bootstrap website, even though there are almost 700 lines of CSS code!
- Inline private messaging. Replies to messages appearing as a conversation thread instead of individual separate messages.
- Some form of indication that a post or reply has been updated by the author.
- URLs shown as part of a post or on a user profile automatically converted into a working link without the need for a user to include "http://" etc.
